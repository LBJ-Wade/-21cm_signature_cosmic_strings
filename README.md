# Numerical Simulations of Cosmic Strings in Interferometer Data

Author: David Maibach
Last Update: 20.05.21
Note: This code was created in the context of my master's thesis at ETH Zurich. The results of the simulations you find in this repository 
are published in "Extracting the Signal of Cosmic String Wakes from 21-cm Observations" (...) in the following refered to as [1].

This repository provides all tools and python files to recreate the numerical simulations describes in [1]. The code is thoroughly commented and
selfexplainatory. For further clarification of theoretical concepts, see [1].

The project is devided into 4 distinct pyhton files. "Angular_power_sp.py" contains a routine to calculate the angular power spectrum of LCDM fluctuations
using the package PyCosmo (https://cosmo-docs.phys.ethz.ch/PyCosmo/PyCosmo.html) developed at ETH Zurich by the Cosmology Group around Prof. Alexandre
Refregier.
